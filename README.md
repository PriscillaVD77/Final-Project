# Final Project

## Outline
### Dataset
The datasets used in the project are hosted on the Kaggle database. They can be downloaded at the following link: <br>

### Goal
The selected topic for our model is based on the dataset pertaining movieâ€™s tomato status given by critics. This topic was selected so that we can understand what features are important to receiving a fresh or rotten status. In our source data we have information that includes 22 columns:
<br>
- movie link <br>
- movie title <br>
- movie info <br>
- critic consensus <br>
- content rating <br>
- genres <br>
- directors <br>
- authors <br>
- actors <br>
- original release date <br>
- streaming release date <br>
- runtime <br>
- production company  <br>
- tomatometer status <br>
- tomatometer ratings <br>
- tomatometer count <br>
- audience status <br>
- audience rating <br>
- audience count <br>
- tomatometer top critic ratings <br>
- tomatometer top fresh critic ratings <br>
- tomatometer rotten critic ratings <br>
<br>
The goal of this project is to understand what features will help us determine which movies will receive a tomato status of fresh or rotten. We will use tomato status as our target for our model. We hope to construct a model that will accurately predict tomato status for future movies. <br>

## Tools and Techniques



## Challenges
The dataset shows some challenges that might become present in our project. The dataset will require effiecient preprocessing to be able to use the dataset optimally. We also face the challenge of knowing if we have enough features to accuratuley fit our model to be able to predict our target. This might require an additional dataset to merge with our current dataset.
